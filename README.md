# Nmap & Scapy Lab

This repository documents hands-on laboratory exercises using **Nmap** and **Scapy**
as part of a cybersecurity practical assignment.

The objective of this lab was to understand how network scanning, enumeration,
and packet-level analysis are performed in real-world cybersecurity environments.

---

## Objectives
- Perform host discovery and port scanning using Nmap
- Identify running services and operating systems
- Use Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for basic security checks
- Craft, send, sniff, and analyze packets using Scapy
- Understand how these tools are applied in penetration testing and network defense

---

## Environment Setup
- Operating System: Kali Linux
- Tools:
  - Nmap
  - Python 3
  - Scapy
- Target: Local lab / authorized test environment

---

## Nmap Exercises
The following Nmap scans were performed and documented:
- Host discovery
- TCP and UDP port scanning
- Service and version detection
- Operating system fingerprinting
- Basic NSE scripting

Each scan includes:
- Command used
- Screenshot (where applicable)
- Brief explanation of purpose and results

---

## Scapy Exercises
Scapy was used for:
- Packet crafting and sending
- Packet sniffing
- Basic protocol analysis

Each script includes comments explaining what the code does and how it works.

---

## Key Learnings
- How attackers and defenders enumerate networks
- The importance of authorization before scanning
- How packet-level visibility improves network security understanding
