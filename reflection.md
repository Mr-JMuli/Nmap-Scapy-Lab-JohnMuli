## Reflection

This lab improved my understanding of how network scanning and packet
analysis are used in cybersecurity.

Nmap helped me understand how systems are discovered and enumerated,
while Scapy provided insight into how network protocols work at a low level.

The main challenge was interpreting scan results correctly and understanding
packet structures.

These tools are essential in penetration testing, incident response,
and network defense.
